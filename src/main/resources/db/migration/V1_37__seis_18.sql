        'Undergraduate studies in the according study program should provide for superb engineering staff capable of satisfying the ever-increasing demand for software engineers, especially programmers. Students enrolled in this study program acquire knowledge enabling them great professional flexibility and wide choice of employment opportunities wherever there is a need of analysis, specification, design, planning, implementation and programming, project management and maintaining software and information systems. Bachelor of Engineering of this profile can build his own career in software industry, in public and service sector, but especially in software development companies, real-time information systems, mobile and hybrid applications, internet and cloud software, advanced user interfaces, solutions related to design and implementation of software systems, etc.',
        '', 'Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering and Information Technologies (240 ECTS)', e'In the curriculum, it is planned to have 29 compulsory subjects and 12 optional subjects. All optional subjects are divided into three difficulty groups (H1, H2 and H3). The weight is shown in the item code. Subjects containing L1 are subjects of weight group H1. Subjects containing L2 are subjects of weight group H2. Subjects that contain L3 in the code are subjects of weight group H3. The rules for optional subjects according to the level are defined as:
•	Number of subjects from H1 - the total number of credits of selected elective subjects from group H1 must not exceed 6 credits.
•	Number of H2 subjects - the total number of credits of selected elective subjects from the H2 group must not exceed 36 credits.
•	Number of H3 subjects – there is no limit to the number of selected subjects from the H3 group.
The student can choose more courses from group H1 and group H2 than the number provided, but in that case the credits earned for these courses do not count towards the total number of credits needed to obtain the diploma. The student can receive a maximum of 6 ECTS credits from extracurricular activities approved by the teaching and scientific council of the faculty. Passed subjects and earned credits will be part of the list of passed subjects in the certificate of passed subjects after graduation from the faculty.',
